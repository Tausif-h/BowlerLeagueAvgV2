# BowlerLeagueAvgV2
This is my program in C++. This program calculates a bowling league's average bowling scores. The bowling scores are in a .txt file, where each bowler has 5 scores. The program reads the scores and inputs the data and calculates each bowlers average score. This code uses an array of structure.
